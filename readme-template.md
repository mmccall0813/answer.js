# answer.js
A bookmarklet-based blooket auto-player that uses the offical blooket api to get question answers.

## How to use?

First get the bookmarklet (bookmark script) from [here](https://mmccall0813.github.io/answer.js/loader.html) by dragging the link on the page to your bookmarks bar. 

Execute (click on bookmark) on the PIN screen, then enter pin as you normally would. It will auto-play the game for you, and get all questions correct.

## What modes does it work on?

Auto-play supported on:

- Gold Quest
- Crypto Hack
- Fishing Frenzy
- Battle Royale (beware, very blatant)
- Classic (beware, very blatant)

Running the cheat on unsupported modes will still auto-answer questions, but will not auto-play the game for you.
