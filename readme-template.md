# answer.js
A bookmarklet-based blooket auto-player that uses the offical blooket api to get question answers.

Execute on the PIN screen, then enter pin as you normally would. It will auto-play the game for you, and get all questions correct.

Currently working on:

- Gold Quest

Auto-answer *should* work on all modes, but I've only tested on cryptohack mode.
