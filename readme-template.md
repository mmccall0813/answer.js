# answer.js
A bookmarklet-based blooket auto-player that uses the offical blooket api to get question answers.

## How to use?

First get the bookmarklet (bookmark script) from [here](https://mmccall0813.github.io/answer.js/loader.html) by dragging the link on the page to your bookmarks bar. 

Execute (click on bookmark) on the PIN screen, then enter pin as you normally would. It will auto-play the game for you, and get all questions correct.

Currently functional on:

- Gold Quest
- Crypto Hack
- Battle Royale (beware, very blatant)
- Classic (beware, very blatant)

Auto-answer *should* work on all modes, make an issue if theres a mode that auto-answer doesn't work on.
